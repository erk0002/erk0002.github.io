            <p>
                Welcome Tristan van Erk,
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you for submitting your “Who Am I?” form. The feedback given here is for you to use when you start
                the program, so you don’t have to respond to it just now.
                <br>
                <br>
                Reading your motivation, it is clear you have some experience and an interest in developing programs. I
                am glad to see this, and I am interested in hearing the reason behind your interest. Why do you find
                these subjects interesting? What do you wish to develop? Is there a challenge you already set for
                yourself? A strong motivation will help you complete the study program successfully, and overcome times
                where it will feel difficult or stressful to do so.
                <br>
                <br>
                When looking at your goals after completing the studies, it is nice to see you are interested in
                becoming a software engineer. Besides working on code, what else do you enjoy in being a software
                engineer? Why does it appeal to you more than being a programmer? Are there other options that will
                allow you to express your creativity? Would you enjoy working in a team? I would recommend you to try
                and research more about software engineering but maybe other positions as well just to understand your
                options, what would you like to do in your day to day? How would you like your role to look like? Look
                more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught. I also recommend you participate in the
                ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information about different
                professions in the ICT field.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking at your SWOT analysis, it is noticeable you are aware of one of your dominant strengths which
                can potentially become a weakness or a threat. The recognition and your existing plan to prevent it from
                becoming a threat is admirable and beneficial. As you mentioned yourself, breaks and setting limitations
                to perfectionism will benefit your mental and physical health, as working on the same assignment or task
                for too long will not give you rest and will potentially lead to a burn out. Aspiring for the best
                results is respectful, but please do not do it on a personal cost. Take care of yourself, don’t be too
                harsh on yourself and I recommend preparing mentally for situations where the result will not be exactly
                what you expect it to be, remember there will be group projects and there will be team members with
                different mentalities and approaches, its important to discuss and be open about your expectations from
                each other to prevent it from becoming unpleasant for everyone. I am sure you will put this to good use,
                and it will benefit you a lot during your studies, but with limitations. Enjoy these four years as well,
                take breaks, have fun too! Its not less important. Also, as you mentioned yourself youll have multiple
                sources of help and advice, fellow students, student assistants, lecturers, and your personal study
                career coach, so please feel free to escalate when needed and consult for solutions.
                <br>

                I have noticed you marked yes in two of the bottom 3 questions, in case you would like a personal
                conversation with one of the teachers to ask in depth questions let us know by sending an email to
                daphne.heertjes@hz.nl .
                <br>
                <br>
                I am looking forward to meeting you this coming year and wish you a lovely summer break!
                <br>
                <br>
                Shirel.

            <p>
                Getting feedback on my "Who Am I?" form was quite enlightening. Shirel's genuine interest in my
                motivations is a good sign, and it's making me think deeper about why I want to be a software engineer
                instead of just a programmer. Maybe there are more cool options out there in the ICT field.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shirel's point about my perfectionism is spot on. I've got to remember to take it easy sometimes and not
                overdo it, for my own sake. Her advice about enjoying college life and using the support network is
                pretty practical.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, the idea of having a chat with a teacher sounds like a good idea if I need it. Looking forward to
                the upcoming academic year and meeting Shirel and everyone else.
